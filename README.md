Hi! My name is [Cristina Rodriguez ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/crissrodriguez/) and I am a software engineer. I received training from Hackbright Academy, an engineering bootcamp for women in San Francisco  (graduation: March 2017). I used to work as a project manager in a software company and there I got interested in learning Python and being able to create my own software projects.
